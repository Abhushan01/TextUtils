# TextUtils
*Text Analyzing Tool made using Django Framework*
<br><br>
**In this project we create a website using Django, which will take text data as input from the user and based upon the option the user selects will give the output accordingly.**
<br><br>
The site provides the following text analyzing tools to play around to the user:
<ul>
<li>Remove Punctuations marks from the text. e.g.- !@#{}[]</li>
<li>To UPPPERCASE the entered text </li>
<li>Removing New Lines</li>
<li>Removing extra spaces from the sentences</li>
<li>Counting the number of characters entered</li>
</ul>

I have used Python as backend language and Bootstrap v5.0 for the frontend.
